# Function
A function is a unit of code that only executes when invoked. A function may return data as a result. In Python, a function is defined with the `def` keyword.

## 3. Return Statement
The Python return statement is a special statement that **can be used within a function or method to return the function's results to the caller**.

Characteristics:
- contains the return keyword followed by an optional return value
- Python functions can return any Python object
- might be placed in a variable to distinguish it from a function that does not return a value (also known as a procedure).
